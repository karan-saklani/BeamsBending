The repository has two files :
<h2>General Functions</h2> <br> 
This file contains functions to solve basic queries and has support for all cross sections. A few codes for cross sections are :
<ul>
<li> Rectangular - r </li>
<li> Semicircle - sc </li>
<li> Circle - c </li>
<li> Triangle - rt </li>
<\ul>
The code is interactive and does not involve the use of spreadsheets.
<h2> Asymmetric Bending for Rectangular Cross Section </h2> <br>
This file is recommended for rectnagular cross sections. An excel sheet named MI.xlsx can be used to evaluate the same. All values must be entered in the spreadsheet. Here 
<ul> <li> b - Length along the x axis </li>
<li> h - length along the y axis </li>
<li> x - x co-ordinate of the centroid </li>
<li> y - y co-ordinate of the centroid </li>
</ul>
